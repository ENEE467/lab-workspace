# ROS Workspace for Lab Exercises

Go to the [Read the Docs](https://enee467.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page to get started!

If you wish to have your own copy of this workspace on GitHub to save the work, create a new
repository on your GitHub account using this repository as a **template**. Otherwise you can directly
clone this repository and name the workspace folder with the group name.

Modify the `<workspace-name>` field and clone the repository to the `home` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ENEE467/lab-workspace.git ~/<workspace name>
```
